## Test Accuracy Results Breakdown by Complexity Level

| Complexity      | Total Tests | Passed | Failed | Avg. Score |
|-----------------|------------|--------|--------|------------|
| Simple          | 3          | 0      | 3      | 0.36       |
| Intermediate    | 3          | 0      | 3      | 0.36       |
| Complex         | 3          | 0      | 3      | 0.36       |
| Other/Unit      | 22         | 22     | 0      | 1.00       |

- Heuristic accuracy tests for Text2SQL queries scored 0.36 (below threshold) for all natural language cases.
- All other unit and integration tests passed.

## Query Performance Metrics (Execution Time Distribution)

- All queries executed within 1 second (as measured in tests).
- No timeouts or slow queries detected in the current test suite.
- Query cache and row limits enforced for performance.

## Failed Queries Analysis with Explanations

- All failed queries were Text2SQL heuristic tests.
- Common reasons:
	- Generated SQL did not match expected columns or structure.
	- LLM/stub output lacked correct aggregation, grouping, or column naming.
	- Schema hints and few-shot examples may need further tuning.
- Example: "Find the top 5 customers by the total sales amount of their orders" returned a score of 0.36 due to missing or mismatched columns.

## Database Optimization Opportunities Identified

- All tables are loaded in 3NF with proper indexes (see `schema.sql`).
- ETL pipeline normalizes and coerces types for optimal query performance.
- Opportunities:
	- Add more indexes for frequent JOIN/WHERE columns (e.g., `customer_id`, `order_id`).
	- Consider partitioning large tables if scaling up.
	- Monitor query plans for slow queries using EXPLAIN.

## Lessons Learned and Challenges Faced

- LLM prompt engineering and few-shot examples are critical for accuracy.
- Schema normalization and type coercion prevent data issues.
- Security enforcement (validator, read-only DB) is essential for safe AI integration.
- Handling encoding issues in CSVs required fallback logic.
- Test-driven development and CI/CD improved reliability.
- Challenge: Achieving high heuristic accuracy for complex queries with LLM.
